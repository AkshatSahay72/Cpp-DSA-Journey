# 🧠 DSA Journey in C++

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) journey in C++**!  
This repository is my daily coding journal for mastering DSA — whether it’s for interviews, competitive programming, GATE prep, or pure problem-solving fun.

## 🚀 About This Repo

This project contains my growing collection of C++ solutions and notes for classic DSA topics.  
It’s my learning diary—documenting logic, approaches, tricks, and struggles as I grind through fundamental and advanced problems.  
From arrays and graphs to recursion and heaps, you’ll find hands-on code with commentary and folder organization to inspire your own journey.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `Array/`  
  Problems related to arrays such as two-pointer techniques, Kadane's algorithm, sliding window, etc.

- `Binary-Search/`  
  Classic and advanced binary search problems covering various applications.

- `Graph/`  
  Graph algorithms including BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, shortest paths, and other graph theory topics.

- `Heap/`  
  Min-heap, max-heap structures, and priority queue challenges.

- `Linked-List/`  
  Singly and doubly linked lists, cycle detection, and variations.

- `Recursion/`  
  Problems illustrating recursion, backtracking, and brute-force techniques.

- `Sorting/`  
  Sorting algorithms, custom comparators, and logic-based sorting problems.

- `Stack/`  
  Stack-related problems including monotonic stacks and Next Greater Element challenges.

- `Tree/`  
  Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, tree traversals, and advanced tree techniques.

- `Timepass/`  
  Miscellaneous practice problems, sketches, and experimental code.

- `.vscode/` (optional)  
  Visual Studio Code configuration and settings files.

- `README.md`  
  This documentation and my personal notes.
